Order Management App
________________________________________________

I developed an Order Management App with the functionality to manage orders and product information. Worked on features of creating, reading, updating, deleting (CRUD), and sorting orders, and dynamical pagination.

* 	Created admin panel layout using HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap.
*  Used AngularJS MVC design pattern to implement data-binding.
*  Created Single Page Apps (SPA) with AngularJS Routing and templates to automatically re-render pages.
*  Stored data in MySQL and implemented database call using Express.js and RESTful APIs.
*  Debugged application using Chrome Developer’s tool and Postman.

<b>Technologies:</b>  HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js, RESTful APIs, MySQL, Chrome Developer’s tool, Postman.
